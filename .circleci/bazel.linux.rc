# These options are enabled when running on CI
# We do this by copying this file to /etc/bazel.bazelrc at the start of the build.
# See documentation in /docs/BAZEL.md

# Import config items common to both Linux and Windows setups.
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/guide.html#bazelrc-syntax-and-semantics
import %workspace%/.circleci/bazel.common.rc

# Save downloaded repositories in a location that can be cached by CircleCI. This helps us
# speeding up the analysis time significantly with Bazel managed node dependencies on the CI.
build --repository_cache=/home/circleci/bazel_repository_cache

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645
# Bazel doesn't calculate the memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker.
# Limit Bazel to consuming resources that fit in CircleCI "xlarge" class
