# We have seen some flakiness in using TS workers on CircleCI
# https://angular-team.slack.com/archives/C07DT5M6V/p1562693245183400
# > failures like `ERROR: /home/circleci/ng/packages/core/test/BUILD.bazel:5:1:
# > Compiling TypeScript (devmode) //packages/core/test:test_lib failed: Worker process did not return a WorkResponse:`
# > I saw that issue a couple times today.
# > Example job: https://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/385517
# We expect that TypeScript compilations will parallelize wider than the number of local cores anyway
# so we should saturate remote workers with TS compilations
